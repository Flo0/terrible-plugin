# terrible-plugin
Literally the worst possible plugin

### Testing
If you need to test your terrible plugin, you can do so using the `docker-compose.yml`. Simply call `docker-compose up` to start up the server.

If you need console access, visit [`localhost:4326`](http://localhost:4326) and add the console widget. You will need to copy the dependencies and whatnot into the plugins folder located in the `dev-server` directory.

The username and password are `admin`.
